This is a 3D printable model made with SolidWorks that works to replace the cylindrical sliders (or plunger) of Topre switches on HHKB. The idea was first come up with Matt3o, and then the NovaTouch implemented the design in their products. For more information you can read [my blog about this project.][4]

This model made several improvements to [Matt3o's beta STL design model][5]. The base stands were made thinner to prevent stucking the rubber dome while pressed. The base was made exactly the same as the original Topre's to retain the touch feeling.

## Compatibility Notes

Since different manufactures may have different specifications in their keycap dimensions, current design may not fit perfectly on every keycap out there. Hence hereby you are welcome to provide any compatibility results to me.

* [The Amazing Chocolatier Custom SA Keycap Set][8] - **Compatible**
* [87U with PuLSE SA Keycap Set][9] - **Wobbly 2.25u** ([Issue #1][10])
