This is a 3D printable model made with SolidWorks that works to replace the cylindrical sliders (or plunger) of Topre switches on HHKB. The idea was first come up with Matt3o, and then the NovaTouch implemented the design in their products.

This model made several improvements to [Matt3o's beta STL design model][1]. The base stands were made thinner to prevent stucking the rubber dome while pressed. The base was made exactly the same as the original Topre's to retain the touch feeling.

I also made an extra 2.25u plunger model for left Shift and Enter keys.

In addition, you can use 6.25u MX spacebar with these stabilizers.

If you have centered stem 6u MX spacebar, you can use these stabilizers.

In case you couldn't buy a PBT Topre 6u spacebar, I also made a model
for you to 3D print it.
