# Topre to Cherry MX Adapter

This is a 3D printable model made with SolidWorks that works to replace the cylindrical slider (or plunger) of Topre switch on HHKB. The idea was first come up with Matt3o, and then the NovaTouch did the same thing.

This model made several improvements to [Matt3o's beta STL design model][1]. The base stands were made thinner to prevent stucking the rubber dome while pressed. The base was made exactly the same as the original Topre's to retain the touch feeling.
